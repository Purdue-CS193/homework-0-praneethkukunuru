# Praneeth Kukunuru's First CS193 Homework

### My favorite things about this CS193 Class
- The Instructors: Having students teach us gives me a much better environment, with little stress. I can also connect wiht the instructors better.
- Exams: This class is supposed to be how every class works. Without any midterms and finals, I can focus solely on learning, which is just awesome.
- The Content: Working on Git hub is something that I have always wanted to try, but couldn't get to. In just a single day, I learnt more about Githib than I did when I tried to learn on my own in a whole week.
- The ease of the class: It also helps that the CS193 class is one of those classes where you learn a lot, and also are able to get an A as long as you put in enough work.
